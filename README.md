# home_regression
Based on Kaggle dataset [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), I worked on several approach for linear regression.

1. Straightforward from-the-shelf linear regression using [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library 
2. More ambitious predcition approch using only [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) library

Additional library used:
- Numpy
- Pandas
